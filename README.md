# Knight Travalis

A program that calculates the shortest possible way to get from one square to another square for a knight chess piece.

The main purpose of this project is to apply the search algorithms in a real problem.

Made for [Knight Travalis](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails) project from The Odin Project.
